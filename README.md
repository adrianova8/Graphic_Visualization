# S04 T01: Graphic Visualization of a Dataset

**Target:**

  * Exploratory analysis
  * Dataframes
  * Reporting

_Complements data exploration techniques through graphical visualization, with the Matplotlib and Searborn libraries._

# Exercise 1
  - Summarize the date set DelayedFlights.csv graphically

  - Create at least one view for:

    + A categorical variable (UniqueCarrier)
    + A numeric variable (ArrDelay)
    + A numeric and a categorical variable (ArrDelay and UniqueCarrier)
    + Two numeric variables (ArrDelay and DepDelay)
    + Three variables (ArrDelay, DepDelay and UniqueCarrier)
    + More than three variables (ArrDelay, DepDelay, AirTime and UniqueCarrier).

# Exercise 2
- Export graphics as images or as html.
 

# Exercise 3
- Integrate the graphical visualizations in task 5 Sprint 3.
